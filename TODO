Represent equations like you did with SML, with structures like Times(eqn, eqn), Plus(eqn, eqn), X, Constant, Pow(eqn, eqn), etc.

Then, when generating practice problems, you choose 2 or 3 rules that you want the user to apply, and the order you want them to be applied. Generate the problem using that.
Do it rule-based, since each rule takes equations from a specific form to another form.




















have option to hide step by step

Layout showing controls

So your options are float, grid, columns?


Integrate shortcuts - have arrow keys for focusing on sidebar buttons?
Finish solvers
Step by step

Levels of computational complexity that might be found in the wild:
  fractions
  square roots




Always think first about the easiest way to do things
Don't forget about the '#' to indicate id
If you just grab a pencil...


design navigation panel
design homepage main layout
design single-page generator layout, incl.
- dropdown
- options
  - number ranges
  - shortcuts for generating and viewing the solution
- input
  - control interface

step by step cross product TeX
step by step mtx mult TeX






## Misc.


### Higher priority:
- Design homepage
- access single-problem generators via a nice responsive menu; you'll need to either do this from scratch, or using some framework
- Think about flexible system for control interface
- Think about input system and correctness checker?
  - Maybe have latex input field but it renders in real time like md?
  - If you do, have (?) button with cheat sheet, and also support as many different input styles as you can


#### Cool features ideas
- Idea! Have a way to generate a sheet of practice problems that prints in a nice format (maybe have a cool way to construct it), and then an answer key!
- What if, while generating the SBS TeX, likely locations for errors are located and pointed out?
  - I mean there's a cool use for machine learning, you could "train" a nnet by having people do problems and tell it where their errors were
    like specific computations that people had trouble with
    and then have the neural net locate in new randomly generated problems where people are likely to have errors
- Dark mode!

### Lower priority:
- is there a way to make it look better when the math loads? Maybe just have MathJax not typeset on load, and have nothing in the thing
- Way to track stats & progress; leaderboard (you'll need actual server-side stuff)
- when you move to hosting, put citations in About page and see if you need citations elsewhere


This js file is going to get big... definitely no reason to load the whole thing always.
You can look into conditional loading (via ajax? because otherwise it's all going to be loaded anyway)
of the code for a certain generator only when that dropdown option is chosen?
  nah, that'll make it less sleek-looking. Unless the initial load time really gets that bad.




#### Name ideas
- Come up with a cool name (need available domain name)
    how about something like "training/(rehearsal?) ground/corner/hall" or something? so it feels like somewhere you come to practice
    (remember that too weird/unrelated a title makes for a hard-to-find website)
