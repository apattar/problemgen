Higher priority:
    Framework for homepage
        Sections for topics
        Buttons for each generator - or maybe use menu system? That way you can get to any page from any other page
        Navigation pane, which takes you to "about"

    Choose engine + system to render math

    Framework for each individual page
        Think about flexible system for control interface
        Think about input system
            Maybe have latex input field but it renders in real time like md?
            If you do, have (?) button with cheat sheet

Lower priority:
    Come up with a cool name (need available domain name)
