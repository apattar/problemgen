# Problem Generator

This repository contains the code for *Problem Generator*, a web application that can generate linear algebraâ€“related practice problems of various types, and show step-by-step walkthroughs of their solutions. For example, it has a reduced row echelon form, determinant, and matrix inverse calculator. There is also a page where users can input a problem and see a step-by-step walkthrough of its solution.

The website uses only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) library and the [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) math display engine for rendering the mathematics.

The site can be accessed at [`apattar.github.io/problemgen`](https://apattar.github.io/problemgen/).
